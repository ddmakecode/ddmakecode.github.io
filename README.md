# About me
Hello, I'm Dan M. My email is ddmakemson@my.waketech.edu.

This is my Github account where I plan to post bits of code and documents I work on throughout this semester.

This repo currently doesn't have much in it, other than this README. I hope to maybe add more to this repo in the future. I believe this also creates a visible website at the address ddmakecode.github.io?

I used the Github Desktop GUI to clone the repository by clicking the "Clone a repository" listing under the + button.

## My Interests
* Open source software

## Cool Websites
[WiGLE](https://wigle.net) is an awesome site. It's a public database of data of Bluetooth, WiFi, and Cell tower networks found while [wardriving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving). It's really cool to see the data of what's mapped out there.

[Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) are important. They're basically the equivalent of the GPL, BSD, and other open source software licenses but for intellectual property.
