# ddmakecode.github.io
Hello, I'm Dan M. My email is ddmakemson@my.waketech.edu.

This is my Github account where I plan to post bits of code and documents I work on throughout this semester.

This repo currently doesn't have much in it, other than this README. I hope to maybe add more to this repo in the future. I believe this also creates a visible website at the address ddmakecode.github.io?

I used the Github Desktop GUI to clone the repository by clicking the "Clone a repository" listing under the + button.
